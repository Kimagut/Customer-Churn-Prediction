# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Every company wants to increase its profit or revenue margin and customer retention is one key area industry players focus their resources. In today's world of machine learning, most companies build classification models to perform churn analysis on their customers. 
Classification in machine learning and statistics is a supervised learning approach in which the computer program learns from the data given to it and makes new observations or classifications. The main goal is to identify which class/category the new data will fall into. 

## Project Overview
This project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework to explore and analyze customer churn. The aim is to leverage data-driven insights to identify key factors influencing churn, build predictive models, and develop actionable recommendations that can help retain valuable customers and enhance their overall service offerings.
## Tools and Programming Languages Used
- VS Code
- Microsoft PowerBI
- GitHub & Git
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Python
- Jupyter notebook
- SQL

## Project Highlights
- Employed the CRISP-DM framework for in-depth analysis of customer churn within the Vodafone network service.
- Performed exploratory data analysis to reveal underlying insights and trends present in the dataset.
- Constructed predictive models utilizing machine learning techniques such as the Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost.
- Utilized hyperparameter tuning to enhance the performance of the models.
- Created an interactive Power BI dashboard for visually representing the key discoveries.
- Authored an enlightening article outlining the project methodology and its outcomes.

## Hypothesis 

### Hypothesis 1: Tenure and Churn

**Null Hypothesis (H0)** :Customers with longer tenure, indicating a longer duration of staying with the company, are more likely to churn compared to new customers.
**Alternate Hypothesis (H1)** : Customers with longer tenure are less likely to churn compared to new customers.

### Hypothesis 2: Monthly Charges and Churn

**Null Hypothesis (Ho):** Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn due to cost considerations.
**Alternative Hypothesis (Ha):** Customers with higher monthly charges are less likely to churn due to cost considerations.
