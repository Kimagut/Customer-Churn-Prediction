# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Every company wants to increase its profit or revenue margin and customer retention is one key area industry players focus their resources. In today's world of machine learning, most companies build classification models to perform churn analysis on their customers. 
Classification in machine learning and statistics is a supervised learning approach in which the computer program learns from the data given to it and makes new observations or classifications. The main goal is to identify which class/category the new data will fall into.
